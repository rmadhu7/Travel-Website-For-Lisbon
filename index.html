		<h3 class="WhyLisbon">Why Lisbon?</h3>
		<p>If you’re dreaming about your next trip to Europe, come and discover Lisbon, a historical city full of stories to tell, where the sun shines 290 days a year and the temperature rarely drops below 15 degree celsius. A city where you feel safe wandering around day or night, where the cuisine is dedicated to creating over a thousand ways to cook the beloved bacalhau (salted cod), and where you’ll find hotels and restaurants to suit every taste, budget and requirement. Lisbon is ageless, but it loves company, as you’ll find out if you meet someone and ask them to explain, with lots of gestures and repetition, where the best place is to listen to Fado. After all, Lisbon is famous for its hospitality and the family-like way it welcomes visitors.

		<p>Lisbon is the second-oldest capital in Europe (after Athens), built on seven hills, just like Rome and other cities. Its rich history goes from occupation by different conquerors (the Moors being the most known), to the great explorers in the 14th and 15th centuries and the Great Earthquake in 1755 that destroyed a large part of the city that had to be rebuilt. Some buildings survived the earthquake and if their walls could talk, you would be in for some unbelievable stories.
		</p>
		<p>It’s the Tagus River (Tejo in Portuguese), the longest river in the Iberian Peninsula. After the Belem area, it flows into the Atlantic Ocean indeed so if you take a day trip from the city, you’ll be able to go to the beach and swim in the ocean.
		</p>
		<p>With the Atlantic Ocean nearby, the temperatures are always mild. The summers aren’t too hot and you won’t be freezing in winter.
		</p>
		<p>If you think Madrid stays out late, try a night out in Lisbon.
		The city is less about heaving clubs and more about a roving nocturnal flow that ends (maybe) when dawn rises over the Tagus River.The main action is in the Bairro Alto, where more than 250 appealing bars line a web of streets between graffiti-plastered walls.</p>
