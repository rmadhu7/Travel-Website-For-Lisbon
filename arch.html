		<p>The Age of Discovery left a legacy of fine architecture in Portugal. The finest examples are found in the country's religious buildings and magnificent palaces, most of them showing outside influences harmoniously blended with local traditions.The earliest architectural monuments are the megaliths and mysterious dolmens in the Alentejo province dating from between 4000 and 2000 BC, and the Celtic hill forts from 800-200 BC in the north of the country. Some of these forts were later absorbed by the Romans, whose architectural legacy includes a temple in Evora, several stone bridges, and residential villas. Of the later Germanic invasions are a handful of Visigothic chapels, and from the Moors are several castles. <b>Romanesque</b> influence arrived in the 11th century when Portugal was emerging as a nation state, brought from France by Burgundian knights and monks. Cathedrals were built in this style as local fortified castles, explained by the need for fortification against the continued military threat of the Moors and, later, the Castilians. The cathedrals of Lisbon, Coimbra, Porto, and Braga therefore have crenellated façade towers.
		</p>
		<p><b>Gothic architecture</b> developed at the end of the 13th century in the center of the country, in the form of large monasteries. The earliest example is the church of Alcobaça's Monastery, considered the finest example of Cistercian architecture in Europe. The most perfect expression of Gothic architecture however, is found in Batalha Monastery.</p>
		<div class="lisbon26"><img src="Images/26.jpg" alt="Gothic architecture" width="200px"/></div>
		<p><b>Manueline style</b> marked the transition from Gothic to Renaissance in Portugal. The first Manueline building was the Church of Jesus in Setubal, and later, Manueline touches were added to Batalha Monastery. The most famous Manueline examples were built next -- Lisbon's Belem Tower and Jeronimos Monastery, and the marvelous window in the castle of Tomar, filled with marine and nautical themes.</p>
		
		<p><b>Vernacular architecture</b> differs greatly according to locally available building materials and climatic conditions. As in most Southern European countries, most houses are built in stone and painted in vivid colors. In the south most houses are whitewashed, with the doors and windows framed in yellow or blue.</p>
		<p>In the 19th century there was an increase in the use of iron and steel in train stations and other grand buildings, reflecting Portugal's emergence as a growing industrial nation. Gustave Eiffel built iron bridges across the major rivers, and the Eiffel Tower-like Santa Justa Elevator was later built in Lisbon.</p>

		<p><b>The Pelourinho:</b> Throughout the centuries, stone columns or pillories ("pelourinhos") were erected in towns all over Portugal. They are believed to have originated in Roman times, becoming prominent in the 12th century. Originally they served as a form of punishment, used to chain criminals, but eventually became a symbol of municipal or feudal authority, placed beside town halls or bishop's palaces.</p>
