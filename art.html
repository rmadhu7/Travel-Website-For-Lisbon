	<p>Lisbon has a wealth of excellent museums, from the world-class Calouste Gulbenkian Museum to the outstanding Ancient Art Museum, and the more recent and acclaimed Design Museum.There are dozens of public and private collections, many housed in former palaces and convents that would be worth a visit even without their museum displays. That's the case of the Tile Museum and the Decorative Arts Museum, where visitors end up spending much more time than they anticipate.Other museums have some of the world's most valuable collections of their kind like the Coaches Museum and the Maritime Museum in the Belem district, also home to the Archaeology Museum and the lavish collection inside Ajuda Palace.</p>
	
	<p>For contemporary Portuguese art there's the Gulbenkian Foundation's Modern Art Center, the Chiado Museum, and the Arpad Szenes - Vieira da Silva Museum, all featuring works by the country's most prominent artists.Also look out for the Berardo Museum, a jaw-dropping collection of modern art with works by the great international artists from Warhol to Picasso inside Belem Cultural Center. A portion of the collection is also on display outside the city in Sintra's Modern Art Museum.Spaces particularly linked to the city of Lisbon are the City Museum, the Fado Museum, and the award-winning Mãe D'Água Water Museum.</p>
	<div class="art02"><img src="Images/art2.jpg" alt="This is Lisbon" width="400px"/></div>
	<p>There are also two extraordinary private art collections that are often overlooked but worthy of a visit for admirers of decorative arts, the Anastácio Gonçalves Museum, and the Medeiros e Almeida Museum.Several churches are also home to small but noteworthy collections, like Carmo Church's eclectic archaeological museum, São Roque Church's rich sacred art collection, and Saint Anthony Church's exhibits about the life of the revered saint that was born on the site -- all of them reminding you that Lisbon itself is a museum-piece of history, ruins and treasures. </p>
